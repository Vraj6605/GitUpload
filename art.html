     art (originally Mithila art) is a style of painting practiced in the Mithila region of India and Nepal. It is named after the Madhubani district of Bihar, India, which is where it originated.[1] Jitwarpur and Ranti are the two most notable cities associated with the tradition and evolution of Madhubani art.[1] The art was traditionally practiced by female members of Brahman and Kayastha castes.[2] Artists create these paintings using a variety of mediums, including their own fingers, or twigs, brushes, nib-pens, and matchsticks. The paint is created using natural dyes and pigments.[3] The paintings are characterized by their eye-catching geometrical patterns. There is ritual content for particular occasions, such as birth or marriage,[2] and festivals, such as Holi, Surya Shasti, Kali Puja, Upanayana, and Durga Puja.

        <p>From 17th century temples to stretched canvases in modern homes, Kalamkari is a time-honored and widely beloved form of traditional Indian art. In fact to me, Kalamkari is a reminder of how art is integral to our sense of fulfillment and wellbeing, how it is synonymous with culture and tradition. I firmly believe that art is unique in its ability to connect us to our humanity and our history â€” and as a distinctly Indian craft, Kalamkari is intertwined with our iconography and mythologies.

            Here, we answer some frequently asked questions about traditional Kalamkari art.
